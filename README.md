Verify emails that are associated with Gmail by cross-checking with Gmails sign-up page. This only works for emails with an @gmail.com domain.
Each line on the text file must contain ONE email, and it cannot contain the @gmail.com ending.

Example of a good text file:
danny12
amandaobrien
teslafans

Example of a bad text file:     Problems:
amandaobrien@gmail.com <---   Contains the @gmail.com domain
        teslafans      <---   Contains an indent
danny12@aol.com        <---   It is not a Gmail address


Script uses the Selenium module, it requires an installation of selenium using pip3.
